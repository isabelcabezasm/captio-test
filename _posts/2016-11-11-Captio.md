## Learning from Building a Mobile Application with *Captio* ##

A team from Microsoft, a Xamarin-expert MVP, and our colleagues from Captio, decided to meet up and migrate the original Captio version developed in Xamarin Classic to the new Xamarin Forms. The team also created a new backend architecture in Azure in order to avoid some system downtimes that the application used to experience – specially at the end of the month when they usually get important usage peaks. In addition, the team was able to incorporate an innovative feature into the final product by using Azure Notification Hubs.

Core Team: 

- Lluis Claramonte ([@lluisclor](https://twitter.com/lluisclor)) –  Captio CTO
- Marc Rubiño ([@marc_rubino](https://twitter.com/marc_rubino)) – Microsoft MVP, Captio CIO
- Isabel Cabezas ([@isabelcabezasm](https://twitter.com/isabelcabezasm)) – Technical Evangelist, Microsoft
- Ester de Nicolás ([@esterdenicolas](https://twitter.com/esterdenicolas)) – Technical Evangelist Mngr, Microsoft


The challenge, which was supported by one of our MVPs, was essentially to change the whole application to **Xamarin Forms** by optimizing the architecture and **coaching** the whole developer team about Xamarin best practices. We can proudly say that after one week of **hack fest**, and some extra help that came from our MVP, the **goal was achieved**. Now, all the developers at Captio are able to work with the same technology on the front-end layer, they have also **reduced the total amount of code**, **equalized the appearance in all platforms**, **reduced the complexity** of their daily work (by deleting useless patterns and using MVVM by default) and, they can now **customize the appearance** of the application for some of their clients, depending of the costumer's needs, and therefore improving usability. 
Regarding the backend, some functionality has been as well migrated to a **Worker Role** and **Push Notifications** have been added to the app. 


Key Technologies:

- Xamarin Forms			
- Push Notification / Notification Hubs			 
- OpenCV 
- Service Bus
- Worker Roles
 
## Customer Profile ##

Captio is a company that was created 5 years ago. They developed an application that enables companies and employees to have an improved control of their **travel expenses**. Captio app integrates the expense’s management process into a single, with a **paperless workflow**, eliminating the need of manual tasks while **preventing fraud**. The services are part of the **financial vertical market**, and among their customers are banking, insurance, healthcare, telecommunications, engineering, food and beverage, and many others. It is, with no doubts, a leading application in the **digital transformation** field – not only in **Spain** but also in **South America**. We knew about Captio some years ago when it was one of our most successful startups inside our BizSpark Plus program in Spain, and we are still continuously working closely with its team through our ISV program. In addition, we can proudly say that every time we have to mention a success story in BizSpark, the name Captio comes up. 

## Problem Statement ##

### (About their technological context) ###

Captio built their **first App version** with **Phone Gap** five years ago, but they were not very convinced with the results. Its capabilities were available on other devices in almost every case, and some of them were not even as good as native. Moreover, performance was neither as good as they expected it to be. That is why, later, they decided to develop the application all over again. 
This time, they created **three native applications** – with the help of some partners – for the three most used platforms: Android, iPhone and Windows Phone. And, this time, both the performance and the capabilities achieved their expectations resulting on the maintenance of the three apps independently for a while, which increased their costs and development efforts.

It was only a matter of time until the CEO heard about **Xamarin** and its biggest **advantage**: they can **share the logic layer code** between their applications, saving costs in maintenance while the application remains native. They tried it and results were good, so they started rebuilding the application on **Classic Xamarin**.

On the other hand, even though all the **backend** of Captio was hosted in **Azure**, since they had a monolithic architecture which is mainly constructed by virtual machines, they cannot auto scale and they experience downtimes, specially by the end of the month when they have peaks of usage. 

## Solutions, Steps, and Delivery ##

*[Our Proposal]*

* Change their **Xamarin Classic** app to **Xamarin Forms**.

* Add some functionality to **improve** the **UX**. 
  For example:

	* User don’t need to use the lateral menu menu in case they only wants to take a photo; the button has been moved to the main screen.

	* The picture will automatically be cropped (improved image - capture process)

	* Users will be able to select a picture from his gallery 
	
* Migrate some functionality from **Azure IaaS to PaaS** (migrating some heavy process to a Service that can auto scale).

*[Benefits]* 		

* Reduced the amount of code 
* New look & feel 
* Equalized the appearance in all platforms, 
* Reduced the complexity (deleting useless patterns and using MVVM by default) 
* Easier customize the appearance of the application for some costumers, depending of their client’s needs. 
* Improved image-capture process
* Migrated OCR reading into a Worker Role  
* Added Push Notifications to the app. 


### From Xamarin Classic to Xamarin Forms  
As a cross-platform UI API, Xamarin.Forms enables developers to create and share user interfaces across iOS, Android and Windows Phone. At the same time, they have the option to use native controls of each mobile platform while creating the user interface. Thus, it becomes easier for them to customize the user interface’s look and feel for individual mobile platforms.

Equalized appearance in all platforms:

### Understanding the utility of the app and its dataflow ###

Captio is an app that enables companies and their employees an improved control of their expenses and the discovery of new savings opportunities. It automatically extracts the data from the receipts and invoices that users capture with their smartphone, so they’ll never have to type expenses manually again. Captio integrates the expense management process into a single, paperless workflow, eliminating the need for manual tasks and preventing fraud. 

![Ticket reading]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/captio/lectura-datos.png)

Users can easily generate reports with their smartphones, and see charts and graphs to understand more about their expenses. The app classifies expenses automatically to make travel expenses management easier by applying categories and offering customizable fields. It enables greater efficiency by automatizing several tasks such as supervision, bank card reconciliation and managing forward payments and allows managers to analyze their team’s expenses from different perspectives, and can automatically check that each expense complies with company policy. Captio is really easy to use: Simple and hassle-free for the people travelling and those that supervise them.

![App Workflow]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/captio/workflow.png)

The dataflow starts when the user takes a picture of the expense ticket with his/her mobile phone:  

![Taking Picture]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/captio/taking.png)

One of the updates introduced in the Azure infrastructure is isolating the process of uploading the picture: Now it’s saved as a Blob object into Azure Storage. 

![Data WorkFlow]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/captio/dataflow.png)

Once the ticket has been uploaded as a Blob object, there is a Worker Role that is notified through an Azure Queue. The message of the Queue includes the blob object ID. 

Once the Worker Role receives the message, it accesses the blob, and runs an OCR process over the image to extract the data of the ticket. Once the worker role does OCR reading, it stores the data extracted in Azure SQL

![OCR Reading]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/captio/ocr_reading.png)

Once the image has been read, data is automatically updated. Now, the expense category and the information about the ticket can be modified. 

### Improving the UX and adding new features ###

#### The first time the application is opened ####

In the previous version, the first screen that the user sees when he opens the application is a menu, and no further instructions or usage guidance. 
In addition, the first time the app is opened, it must load some features and synchronize the data which requires some time and therefore the user experience may be inadequate.

**Warm up**

The first time the app is opened, while it is loading data and synchronizing the user’s information, a progress screen was added where the progression of the procedure can be visualized, with amusing and vintage sentences such us “Cleaning the objective of the camera” or “loading the film roll”.

**Wizard / usage guide**

In new version, we have a usage guide of three images which explain very concisely how the application must be used.

![User guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/captio/user-guide.png)

**Just use it!** 

![Use it!]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/captio/first.png)

After that, the first screen the user will see is a simple design: just a button to take an expense picture. 

![First screen]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/captio/first_screen.png)


#### Custom fields ####

Custom fields could be added to some categories. For instance: in the demo, when the expense is categorized as “Restaurant”, “Number of diners” has been added as a new field.
This new feature allows companies to personalize the data required for the different categories according to their compliance policies.

![Custom fields]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/captio/custom_field.png)

#### SmartPhoto ####
An automatic trimming of the photo has been added. 
The edge of the ticket is detected and the photo is cropped so that only the important part of the picture is saved. 
This change improves the image capturing process and speeds it up, while optimizing the Azure Storage needs.

## Architecture ##

### (explained from dataflow) ###

Once the picture is taken, it is uploaded to a Blob Storage. 
The OCR reading is made by a worker role. 
The data extracted from the OCR reading is saved in an Azure SQL.

## Conclusion ##

+ We have drastically improved code coverage and the quality of unit testing. 
    + The unified API allowed us to test the functionality better and easier, because the code base shares much more code, so the tests have to be written only once.
    + Furthermore, there are other factors like the MVVM pattern that enforces a separation of the XAML UI (the View) from the underlying data (the Model) and the UI logic.
    This pattern makes the testing easier as well.
    + We used the Xamarin.UITests testing framework, that can be used in Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android, and it is an automated UI acceptance testing framework.
    + Xamarin also provides awesome UI testing with the Xamarin.TestCloud service, which is a cloud-based solution that provides tools that enable automated UI Acceptance Testing of mobile applications across hundreds of different devices.

+ Increasing the amount of shared code.
During the hackfest, most of the developers have learnt a new skill: XAML + C#, that complements their previous knowledge and experience in iOS/XCode or Android/Java. As they are now sharing the same codebase, they can also share the backlog, increasing the team agility and almost any developer in the team can now develop for all the platforms, while before they had to live divided by technology.

+  Xamarin .Forms has strong support for advanced development tooling and process control such as unit testing, mocking, dependency injection and inversion of control.


## General lessons ##

+ Every Java/Android developer about Android development is slow.
Maybe not the development itself, but the process of deploy to emulator or to the real test device is slower than deploy using Android Studio, specially to real devices.

+ When required, developers can use native UI controls and renders if the functionality for a given platform does not feel right, given the out of the box functionality.
Fortunately, Captio did not have a lot of animations, didn't require native UI controls behavior nor complex screens, because they are a little tedious to build. 

+ Although most people are afraid about Xamarin Forms performance, the fact is that, in our tests, it was very close to the native platforms and even faster in some scenarios. In fact, in some tests, our application in Xamarin Forms is much faster than the same action in Xamarin Classic.
