## Learning from Building a Mobile Application with *Captio* ##

A team from Microsoft, a Xamarin-expert MVP, and our colleagues from Captio, decided to meet up and migrate the original Captio version developed in Xamarin Classic to the new Xamarin Forms. The team also created a new backend architecture in Azure in order to avoid some system downtimes that the application used to experience – specially at the end of the month when they usually get important usage peaks. In addition, the team was able to incorporate an innovative feature into the final product by using Azure Notification Hubs.

Core Team: 
- Lluis Claramonte ([@lluisclor](https://twitter.com/lluisclor)) –  Captio CTO
- Marc Rubiño ([@marc_rubino](https://twitter.com/marc_rubino)) – Microsoft MVP, Captio CIO
- Isabel Cabezas ([@isabelcabezasm](https://twitter.com/isabelcabezasm)) – Technical Evangelist, Microsoft
- Ester de Nicolás ([@esterdenicolas](https://twitter.com/esterdenicolas)) – Technical Evangelist Mngr, Microsoft


The challenge, which was supported by one of our MVPs, was essentially to change the whole application to **Xamarin Forms** by changing its technology and **teaching** the whole developer team how to use Xamarin. We can proudly say that after one week of **hack fest**, and some extra help that came from our MVP, the **goal was achieved**. Now, all the developers at Captio are able to work with the same technology on the front-end layer, they have also **reduced the total amount of code**, **equalized the appearance in all platforms**, **reduced the complexity** of their daily work (by deleting useless patterns and using MVVM by default) and, they can now **customize the appearance** of the application for some of their clients (depending on the client’s needs). 
Regarding the backend, some functionality has been as well migrated to a **Worker Role** and **Push Notifications** have been added to the app. 


Key Technologies:
- Xamarin Forms			
- Push Notification / Notification Hubs			 
- OpenCV 
- Service Bus
- Worker Roles
 
## Customer Profile ##

Captio is a company that was created 5 years ago. They developed an application that enables companies and employees to have an improved control of their **travel expenses**. Captio app integrates the expense’s management process into a single, with a **paperless workflow**, eliminating the need of manual tasks while **preventing fraud**. The services are part of the **financial vertical market**, and among their customers are banking, insurance, healthcare, telecommunications, engineering, food and beverage, and many others. It is, with no doubts, a leading application in the **digital transformation** field – not only in **Spain** but also in **South America**. We knew about Captio some years ago when it was one of our most successful startups inside our BizSpark Plus program in Spain, and we are still continuously working closely with its team through our ISV program. In addition, we can proudly say that every time we have to mention a success story in BizSpark, the name Captio comes up. 

## Problem Statement ##
### (About their technological context) ###

Captio built its **first App version** with **Phone Gap** five years ago, but they were not very convinced with the results. Its capabilities were available on other devices in almost every case, and some of them were not even as good as the native one. Moreover, the performance was not as good as they expected it to be. That is why, later, they decided to develop the application all over again. 
This time, they created **three native applications** – with the help of some partners – for the three most used platforms: Android, iPhone and Windows Phone. And, this time, both the performance and the capabilities achieved their expectations resulting on the maintenance of the three apps independently for a while, *bearing the costs*.

It was only a matter of time until the CEO heard about **Xamarin** and its biggest **advantage**: they can **share the logic layer code** between their applications, saving costs in maintenance while the application remains native. They tried it and results were good, so for the last years, they have been working in the application, built with **Classic Xamarin**.

On the other hand, even though all the **backend** of Captio was hosted in **Azure**, since they had a monolithic architecture which is mainly constructed by virtual machines, they cannot auto scale and they experience downtimes, specially by the end of the month when they have peaks of usage. 

## Solutions, Steps, and Delivery ##

*[Our Proposal]*

* Change their **Xamarin Classic** app to **Xamarin Forms**.

* Add some functionality for **improving** the **UX**. 
  For example:

	* The user don’t need to use the lateral menu menu in case he only wants to take a picture since the picture button has been moved to the main screen.

	* The picture will automatically be cropped (improved image - capture process)

	* The user will be able to select a picture from his gallery 
	
* Migrate some functionality from **Azure IaaS to PaaS** (migrating some heavy process to a Service that can auto scale).

*[Benefits]* 		

* Reduced the amount of code New look & feel 
* Equalized the appearance in all platforms, 
* Reduced the complexity (deleting useless patterns and using MVVM by default) 
* Easier customize the appearance of the application for some clients, depending of their client’s needs. 
* Improved image-capture process
* Migrated OCR reading into a Worker Role  
* Added Push Notifications to the app. 


### From Xamarin Classic to Xamarin Forms  
As a cross-platform UI API, Xamarin.Forms enables developers to create and share user interfaces across iOS, Android and Windows Phone. At the same time, they have the option to use native controls of each mobile platform while creating the user interface. Thus, it becomes easier for them to customize the user interface’s look and feel of the user interface for individual mobile platforms.

Equalized appearance in all platforms:

### Understanding the utility of the app and its dataflow ###

Captio in an app that helps the user with accounting.
It can be used for both personal accounts and corporate’s finances. It automatically extracts the data from the receipts and invoices that the user captures with a smartphone, so that he’ll never have to type expenses manually again.

![Ticket reading](../images/captio/lectura-datos.png)

The user is able to generate now with his smartphone expense reports, charts, graphs and get to know more about his expenses. Even build a workflow for his company’s expenses, automate the tasks required to control and manage a team’s expenses. In addition, Captio is easy to use since it is system tailored to your users: simple and hassle-free for the people travelling and those that supervise them.

![App Workflow](../images/captio/workflow.png)

Once the ticket has been uploaded as a Blob object, there is a Worker Role that is notified through an Azure Queue. The message of the Queue includes the blob object ID. 

Once the Worker Role receives the message, access to the blob, and runs an OCR process over the image to extract the data of the ticket, the worker role does OCR reading, and stores the data extracted in Azure SQL


![OCR Reading](../images/captio/ocr_reading.png)

Once the image has been read, the data is automatically updated. Now, the expense category and the information about the ticket can be modified. 


#### Taking the picture ####
Use the  mobile phone camera to get a photo of the expense ticket.

![Taking Picture](../images/captio/taking.png)

One of our updates in the Azure infrastructure is isolating the uploading picture.
Now it’s saved as a Blob object into Azure Storage.

### Improving the UX and adding new features ###

#### The first time the application is opened ####

In the previous version, the first screen that the user sees when he opens the application is a menu, and no further instructions or usage guidance. In addition, the first time the app is opened, it must load some features and synchronize the data, so the user experience may be inadequate.

**Warm up**

The first time the app is opened, while it is loading data and synchronizing the user’s information, a progress screen was added where it can be visualized the progression of the procedure with amusing and vintage sentences such us “Cleaning the objective of the camera” or “loading the film roll”.

**Wizard / usage guide**

In our new version, we have a usage guide of three images which explain very concisely how the application must be used.

![User guide](../images/captio/user-guide.png)

**Just use it!** 

![Use it!](../images/captio/first.png)

After that, the first screen the user will see is one with a simple design: just a button to take the photo. Take your first picture. 

![First screen](../images/captio/first_screen.png)


#### Custom fields ####

Custom fields could be added to some categories. For instance: in the demo, when the expense is categorized as “Restaurant”, “Number of diners” has been added as a new field.

![Custom fields](../images/captio/custom_field.png)

#### SmartPhoto ####
An automatic trimming of the photo has been added. The edge of the ticket is detected and the photo is cropped so that only the important part of the picture is saved. It improves the capturing-image process and speeds it up.

## Architecture ##
### (explained from dataflow) ###

Once the picture is taken, it is uploaded to a Blob Storage. 
The OCR reading is made by a worker role. 
The data extracted from the OCR reading is saved in an Azure SQL.
