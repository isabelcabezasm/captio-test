# Xamarin helps Captio solve one of the greatest productivity blockers: Expense Reports




## Solution & Benefits

_[Speak about the technological context]_

Captio built their app **first version** using **Phone Gap**, five years ago, but they were not convinced by the results because capabilities were more or less available on most devices, but some were not as good as native. The performance neither was as good as they expected.

Then they developed the application again. This time they did **three native applications**, helped by some partners, for the three platforms more used: Android, iPhone, and Windows Phone. Both performance and capabilities achieved their expectation, so the three applications were **maintained**
independently for a while, bearing the **costs**. 

Over time the CEO heard about **Xamarin** and its **biggest advantage**: they can share the logic layer code between their applications, **save costs** in maintenance, and the application still is **native**. They tried it and results were
good, so for the last years, they have been working in the application, built with **Classic Xamarin**. 

In other hand, all the **backend** of Captio is hosted in **Azure**, and they have a **monolithic architecture**, using mainly **virtual machines**. They cannot use the auto scale and have downtimes, specially by the end of the month when they have
peaks of usage.

_[Our Proposal]_

Change from their
**Xamarin Classic** app **to Xamarin Forms.**

Add some functionality for improving the **UX**. 

For example: 

* The user don’t need to use the lateral menu if you only want to take the photo, the button was moved to the main screen. 
* Added an automatic trimming of the photo (improving image- capture process)
* Added the option of select a picture from gallery

Migrate some functionality from Azure **IaaS to PaaS** (migrating some heavy process to a Service that can auto scale).

_[Benefits]_

·      
Reduced the amount of code, 

·      
New look & feel

·      
Equalized the appearance in all platforms, 

·      
Reduced the complexity (deleting useless patterns and
using MVVM by default) 

·      
Easier customize the appearance of the application for
some clients, depending of their client’s needs. 

·      
Improved image-capture process

·      
Migrated OCR reading into a Worker Role  

·      
Added Push Notifications to the app.
